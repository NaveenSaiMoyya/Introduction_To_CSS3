<h1>POSITIONING</h1>
-> 4 position properties : static
                           relative
                           absolute
                           fixed

Static: 
        - default value for elements.
        - place in next available position.
        - not affected by the top, bottom, left & right properties.

Relative:
        - positioned "relative to itself".
        - takes static position & can add offsets.
        - new positioning does not affect any other element.
        - it is possible to move an element and leave a big hole where it would have been.

Absolute:
        - element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to it's nearest ancestor(root).
        - other elements behave as if element does not exist.
        - can end up on top of another element.

Fixed:
        - positioned relative to the browser window.
        - will not move, even if the window is scrolled.
        - used as navigation bar that is always visible on the top.

<h1>Z-INDEX</h1>
- multiple elements may be placed in the same position.
- z-index is a numeric value, +ve or -ve that indicates stacking order.
